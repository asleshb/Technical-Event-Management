# Technical Event Management System

## Project Overview

The Technical Event Management System is a full-stack web application developed to simplify the organization and management of technical events such as Hackathons, Coding Competitions, AI/ML Challenges, Robotics Competitions, UI/UX Contests, and Gaming Events. The system provides separate interfaces for Participants and Organizers, enabling efficient event management, registration, and tracking.

The application follows a decoupled architecture with a React frontend, Node.js and Express.js backend, and a MySQL relational database. It offers secure authentication, role-based access control, event management, and participant registration through an intuitive and responsive user interface.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Workbench (Recommended)
- Git

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asleshb/Technical-Event-Management.git
cd Technical-Event-Management
```

---

### Step 2: Database Setup

Start the MySQL Server and create the project database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE myprojectdb;
USE myprojectdb;
```

Create the required database tables.

#### Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    fullname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);
```

#### Organizer Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE organizer (
    organizer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

#### Events Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    organizer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (organizer_id)
        REFERENCES organizer(organizer_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### Registrations Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE registrations (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    fullname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    event_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
        REFERENCES users(id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

Insert the default organizer account.

```sql
INSERT INTO organizer (name, email, password, department)
VALUES (
    'CSE Admin',
    'admin@techfest.com',
    'admin123',
    'Computer Science'
);
```

---

### Step 3: Configure the Database Connection

Open the following file:

```text
backend/db.js
```

Update the MySQL credentials according to your local database configuration.

```javascript
const db = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "127.0.0.1",
    user: "root",
    password: "root",
    database: "myprojectdb",
});
```

---

### Step 4: Install and Run the Backend Server

Navigate to the backend directory.

```bash
cd backend
```

Install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Express server.

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server will start at:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

---

### Step 5: Install and Run the Frontend

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory.

```bash
cd frontend/myapp
```

Install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Start the React development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```
